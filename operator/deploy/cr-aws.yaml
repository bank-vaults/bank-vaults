  # If you are not using IAM instance profiles to authenticate against AWS you can pass in an
  # AWS credentials refering to a Secret with the following configuration block. You have to
  # create the "aws-cred" secret manually, it has to have a key called "credentials" holding
  # the configuration in the following format:
  # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/config-vars.html#the-shared-credentials-file
  # credentialsConfig:
  #   env: AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE
  #   path: /etc/aws/credentials
  #   secretName: aws-cred

  # Or you can follow: https://banzaicloud.com/docs/bank-vaults/cloud-permissions/#aws
  # to give access to AWS S3 and KMS on an EKS cluster (recommended).
