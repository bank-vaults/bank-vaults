*Bank Vaults is a thick, tricky, shifty right with a fast and intense tube for experienced surfers only, located on Mentawai.
Think heavy steel doors, secret unlocking combinations and burly guards with smack-down attitude. Watch out for clean-up sets.*

Bank-Vaults is an umbrella project which provides various tools for Cloud Native secret management, including:

- Bank-Vaults CLI to make configuring Hashicorp Vault easier
- [Vault Operator](https://github.com/bank-vaults/vault-operator/) to make operating Hashicorp Vault on top of Kubernetes easier
- [Secrets Webhook](https://github.com/bank-vaults/secrets-webhook) to inject secrets directly into Kubernetes pods
- [Vault SDK](https://github.com/bank-vaults/vault-sdk) to make working with Vault easier in Go

## Documentation

The official documentation is available at [https://bank-vaults.dev](https://bank-vaults.dev/).

## Development

**For an optimal developer experience, it is recommended to install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) and [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html).**

_Alternatively, install [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) on your computer then run `make deps` to install the rest of the dependencies._

Make sure Docker is installed with Compose and Buildx.

Fetch required tools:

```shell
make deps
```

Run the test suite:

```shell
make test
```

Run linters:

```shell
make lint # pass -j option to run them in parallel
```

Some linter violations can automatically be fixed:

```shell
make fmt
```

Build artifacts locally:

```shell
make artifacts
```

Once you are done, you can clean project dependencies:

```shell
make clean
```
