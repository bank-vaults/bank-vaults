*Bank Vaults is a thick, tricky, shifty right with a fast and intense tube for experienced surfers only, located on Mentawai. Think heavy steel doors, secret unlocking combinations and burly guards with smack-down attitude. Watch out for clean-up sets.*

*Bank-Vaults is an umbrella project which provides various tools for Vault to make using and operating Hashicorp Vault easier. It's a wrapper for the official Vault client with automatic token renewal and built-in Kubernetes support, dynamic database credential provider for Golang `database/sql` based clients. It has a CLI tool to automatically initialize, unseal, and configure Vault. It also provides a Kubernetes operator for provisioning, and a mutating webhook for injecting secrets.*

**Bank-Vaults** is a core building block of the **[Banzai Cloud Pipeline](https://github.com/banzaicloud/pipeline)** platform. Some of the usage patterns are highlighted through these blog posts:

**Securing Kubernetes deployments with Vault:**

- [Authentication and authorization of Pipeline users with OAuth2 and Vault](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/oauth2-vault/)
- [Dynamic credentials with Vault using Kubernetes Service Accounts](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/vault-dynamic-secrets/)
- [Dynamic SSH with Vault and Pipeline](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/vault-dynamic-ssh/)
- [Secure Kubernetes Deployments with Vault and Pipeline](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/hashicorp-guest-post/)
- [Vault Operator](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/vault-operator/)
- [Vault unseal flow with KMS](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/vault-unsealing/)
- [Monitoring Vault on Kubernetes using Cloud Native technologies](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/monitoring-vault-grafana/)
- [Inject secrets directly into pods from Vault](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/inject-secrets-into-pods-vault-revisited/)
- [Backing up Vault with Velero](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/vault-backup-velero/)
- [Vault replication across multiple datacenters on Kubernetes](https://banzaicloud.com/blog/vault-multi-datacenter/)
- [More blog posts about Bank-Vaults](https://banzaicloud.com/tags/bank-vaults/)

We use Vault across our large Kubernetes deployments and all the projects were `reinventing` the wheel. We have externalized all the codebase into this project and removed all the [Pipeline](https://github.com/banzaicloud/pipeline) and [Hollowtrees](https://github.com/banzaicloud/hollowtrees) dependencies thus this project can be used independently as a CLI tool to manage Vault, a Golang library to build upon (OAuth2 tokens, K8s auth, Vault operator, dynamic secrets, cloud credential storage, etc), Helm chart for a HA cluster, operator, mutating webhook and a collection of scripts to support some advanced features (dynamic SSH, etc).

>We take bank-vaults' security and our users' trust very seriously. If you believe you have found a security issue in bank-vaults, please contact us at security@banzaicloud.com.

Bank-Vaults is a core part of [Banzai Cloud Pipeline](https://github.com/banzaicloud/pipeline), a Cloud Native application and devops platform that natively supports multi- and hybrid-cloud deployments.


## Installing

You usually don't need to use the CLI directly, rather you should install the charts and create Vault instances with the operator and use the webhook inside Kubernetes.

To grab the CLI binary go to the [releases](https://github.com/banzaicloud/bank-vaults/releases) page and download it.

On macOS, you can directly Homebrew the CLI:

```
$ brew install banzaicloud/tap/bank-vaults
```

Alternatively, fetch the source and compile it using `go get`:

```shell
go get github.com/banzaicloud/bank-vaults/cmd/bank-vaults
go get github.com/banzaicloud/bank-vaults/cmd/vault-env
```
